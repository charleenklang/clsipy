# Common LaTeX Service Interface
The Common LaTeX Service Interface (CLSI) is an HTTP RESTful API for compiling LaTeX
documents online.

### How to get access
To access the CLSI server you will need a developer token. To request a
token, please email the server maintainer. 

### How to report a missing package
If the CLSI maintainer decided to run a striped-down version of LaTeX,
it is possible that some packages are not installed by default. Please
contact the CSLI maintainer for more information regarding available
packages.

### Client
If you are looking for a client to access this CLSI server,
check out the [Remote LaTeX](http://github.com/pacbard/RLatex) client.
